1
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,790
Eye color, hair color...

2
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:27,450
Even her body appears totally different.

3
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:34,790
I see. This explains how Angie Sirius
has been able to blind eyes around the world.

4
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:45,870
Lina, stop!

5
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,330
I don't want to be your enemy!

6
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,450
An illusion?

7
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,990
What a pain!

8
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:01,160
First, her camouflage was based on looks,
but now, it's based on position.

9
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,830
To break Parade,

10
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,200
I can either destroy the illusion,

11
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,950
then find and attack the main body
before a new illusion is formed,

12
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,490
or locate the main body's coordinates

13
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:12,660
and attack using Idea
without relying on my senses.

14
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:19,830
Her Parade reactivation time is monstrous.

15
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:24,540
It'd be too dangerous to move to Idea mode
while under physical attack.

16
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,040
Jes--

17
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,700
Constant Deceleration.

18
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,410
Self-Repair Spell... Auto-start.

19
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:22,040
I can't show her my cards yet!

20
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,700
Kill Self-Repair Process.

21
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:34,910
Tatsuya, you're crazy.

22
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:39,740
I had to do it in order to capture you.

23
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:44,080
You wanted to capture me? If you wanted
to whisper sweet nothings into my ear,

24
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,450
I would've preferred
a more romantic approach.

25
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:54,410
Activate, Dancing Blades!

26
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:03,290
Two heading for my right arm,
one for my right shoulder, left arm and legs.

27
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:05,450
None of them are aimed at a vital spot.

28
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,540
Corrosion...

29
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,490
No, dismantling?

30
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:14,240
You'll regret this, Tatsuya!

31
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:20,950
I've let the target I nearly captured escape.
I already regret this plenty.

32
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,450
Somebody!

33
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:36,370
Somebody! Somebody help me!

34
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,620
Raise your hands!

35
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,120
Turn around!

36
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:59,490
It's time to end this charade, Angie Sirius.

37
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,990
I apologize for my rudeness.

38
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:09,540
I am Major Angelina Sirius,
commander of the Stars magician unit...

39
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:15,410
under the direct command
of the USNA Army's Joint Chiefs of Staff.

40
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:18,990
Angie Sirius is the name I use
when transformed like I was before,

41
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:22,160
so please continue to call me Lina.

42
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:29,870
Now that you know my true identity,
the Stars will have to eliminate you.

43
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:33,240
There were plenty of ways to play
around the facts if I still had my mask.

44
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,080
It is unfortunate.

45
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:40,660
I seem to have wasted the consideration
you were kind enough to show me.

46
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:44,240
This really is a shame, Tatsuya.

47
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,160
I'd started to like you
quite a bit, you know.

48
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,330
Goodbye.

49
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,160
I won't let you do that...

50
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,950
Lina!

51
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,990
My legs!

52
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,240
Gee, that was quite the pickle!

53
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,540
Brother, are you all right?

54
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,330
Yes, thanks to you.

55
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:22,080
And now, I've got
some questions for you, Lina.

56
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,240
It's three against one! That's unfair!

57
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,790
Then, shall we have
a fair contest, one-on-one?

58
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:31,790
If you win, I'll let you go for tonight.

59
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:36,660
In exchange, if I win, you'll give
honest answers to my questions.

60
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,290
How does that sound?

61
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,200
Fine.

62
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,660
Wait!

63
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:45,410
Brother, would you approve
of leaving the duel with Lina to me?

64
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:47,950
Miyuki, why would you...

65
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,200
Lina...

66
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,200
I consider you a rival.

67
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:58,080
But I can never forgive you for
attempting to take my brother's life

68
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,240
even if it wasn't sincere.

69
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,660
I'm going to teach you
a lesson for that sin.

70
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,200
But don't worry.

71
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,330
I'm not going to kill you.

72
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:18,450
You think you can beat me, Miyuki?
The one granted the name...

73
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,620
of Sirius?

74
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,290
Okay. I'll let you handle this, Miyuki.

75
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:28,330
That works for you, Lina?

76
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:31,290
Thank you, Brother.

77
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:34,910
If I lose, I'll tell you
whatever you want to know.

78
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:37,620
But that's just not going to happen.

79
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,950
I can imagine what you're thinking.

80
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:56,620
But don't worry.
We'll keep our promise.

81
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,910
We're just going to ask some questions.

82
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:02,240
I'll only tell you if you beat me.

83
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,660
Of course. We'll keep that promise, too.

84
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:12,580
Unworthy though I may be, I, Yakumo Kokonoe,
will preside over this duel.

85
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:17,790
Victory will be when one person
surrenders or is incapacitated.

86
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:21,660
No killing. It'll leave a grudge.

87
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,370
Understood. That's fine.

88
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,740
I'll finish this before it gets to that.

89
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,490
Then, shall we begin?

90
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:32,120
Please wait a moment, Master.

91
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,240
Um...

92
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,910
Brother?

93
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:41,740
U-U-Um...

94
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,540
This...

95
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,040
Why?

96
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,370
I had it shown to me before in Yokohama.

97
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:11,540
It might not be perfect, but I remember how.

98
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:17,040
The effect is temporary,
but it returns your control, Miyuki.

99
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,410
Fight to your heart's content.

100
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:21,870
I will!

101
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,620
I'm sorry for the delay, Master.

102
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,660
You, too, Lina.

103
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:34,370
If you're not feeling well,
I'll give you a moment.

104
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:36,790
No, I'm fine!

105
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,580
Then, again...

106
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,450
I'll end this with one attack!

107
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:43,990
Begin!

108
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,660
I suppose it'll take more than that.

109
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,200
Now, it's my turn!

110
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:05,870
It was worth provoking her.

111
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,950
Deceleration Zone!

112
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,330
This magic is...

113
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,740
She saw through it. In that case...

114
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:33,330
Molecular Divider!

115
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,910
Dancing Blades!

116
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,330
That was close.

117
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:48,540
If my brother hadn't returned
control of my magic to me,

118
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,790
I would've lost right there.

119
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:53,580
My brother is watching.

120
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,910
That's why...

121
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,790
I can't believe she shut down that attack!

122
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:04,290
He must've told her how to protect herself
from Dancing Blades then!

123
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:07,580
He wouldn't interfere,
but he did give her advice.

124
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,330
Bring it on!

125
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,080
In that case...

126
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,700
I absolutely can't lose here!

127
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,580
I'll crush her with everything I have!

128
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,790
--Lina!
--Miyuki!

129
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,040
--This is it!
--This is it!

130
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,990
Muspelheim!

131
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,740
Niflheim!

132
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:54,490
That's enough, both of you!

133
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:12,240
Brother, what have you done?

134
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:23,450
Dear me, Tatsuya. You're the one
who suggested this duel,

135
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:26,910
so why did you go
and break it up like that?

136
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,790
If I hadn't,

137
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:33,330
the "no killing" rule would've been broken.

138
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:36,200
We'll say it's my loss.

139
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,910
At that rate, I would've been defeated.

140
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:43,910
I promise I'll answer anything you ask me.

141
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,120
However...

142
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,910
However what?

143
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,740
My answers will be yes or no.

144
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:52,540
If I can't answer a question
that way, then I won't.

145
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,990
You changed the conditions we agreed on
by spoiling our match,

146
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:59,950
so I hope you don't mind me changing
a small condition, as well, Tatsuya!

147
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,050
VISITOR ARC IV

148
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,060
JANUARY 22, 2096

149
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:12,950
Lina!

150
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:15,450
Wake up already!

151
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:24,490
I'm done for! I don't think
I can keep doing this anymore!

152
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,830
I'm turning in the Sirius code name!

153
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:32,040
What's wrong? You're carrying out
your duty as a member of Sirius wonderfully.

154
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:36,910
What kind of commander loses
to a high school student?

155
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:43,580
Have you calmed down, Lina?

156
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,200
Yes.

157
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,910
Sorry, Silvie.

158
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,660
It's all right.

159
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:52,830
Everyone needs to complain sometimes,
or they'll explode.

160
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:59,490
Silvie, has HQ said anything?

161
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:04,700
We don't have any instructions from HQ,
but I'd like to brief you on several reports.

162
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,160
First, regarding the four wounded last night,

163
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,910
one was disabled and probably
won't be able to return to duty.

164
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:13,870
They'll have to be replaced,

165
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:18,660
but the Stars can't afford to dispatch
any more personnel to Japan.

166
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,330
I see.

167
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:24,540
Apparently, the General Staff Office
wants to send Stardust reinforcements.

168
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,910
Are they sending us more chasers?

169
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,870
No, soldiers.

170
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:35,950
I feel like the strength of Stardust
won't be enough to deal with this situation,

171
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,240
but we have no choice.

172
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,620
As for the investigation into the Strategic-Class
magician who caused Scorched Halloween,

173
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:46,990
the other team hasn't gotten
any noteworthy results yet.

174
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,910
Other team...

175
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,830
Mia's group, right?

176
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,870
Come to think of it, I haven't had
the chance to see Mia recently.

177
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:59,830
Right, but she'll be going
to First High tomorrow for work.

178
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:04,370
She's going with a delivery
of CAD adjustment instruments.

179
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,240
My high school?

180
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:12,910
Her afternoon schedule is open,
so why not go meet her for lunch?

181
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,040
Tia!

182
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:33,620
Ray...

183
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,450
That's a lovely dress, Tia.

184
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:39,240
You look even more charming than usual.

185
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,450
Oh, really?

186
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:43,450
Those clothes suit you, too, Ray.

187
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:46,870
I'm honored you said so, Tia.

188
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:49,540
Um, Tia...

189
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:52,370
About what you asked me for...

190
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,660
First, the news
of a parasite appearing is true.

191
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:03,620
The cause is unknown, but I found
some information that seems to be related.

192
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,660
Tell me.

193
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,080
Of course.

194
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,990
This is under
a high-level information freeze,

195
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,740
but in November, in Dallas,

196
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:14,120
they did an experiment
based on extradimensional theory

197
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,410
to generate and evaporate
micro black holes.

198
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,620
Extradimensional theory?

199
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:23,330
Sorry. Even I don't understand the details.

200
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,740
That's okay. What about it?

201
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,620
I don't know the details of the experiment,

202
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:33,830
but the parasites' appearance was observed
right after they wrapped that up.

203
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:39,950
You think the experiment and the appearance
of the parasites are causally related, huh?

204
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:47,700
I'm certain the black hole experiment
was what called the parasites.

205
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:02,370
It's unusual for Tatsuya
to summon us on our day off.

206
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:03,910
True.

207
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:08,620
Oh...

208
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,200
Saegusa...

209
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,160
Jumonji...

210
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,240
Yoshida and Chiba?

211
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,410
Did Shiba call you guys here, too?

212
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,450
Y-Yes.

213
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:23,450
It looks like we're all here.

214
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:29,080
Tatsuya, why did you
summon us on a Sunday?

215
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:34,700
I wanted to inform you regarding
the capture of the parasite we're chasing.

216
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,870
Let's hear it.

217
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:43,080
Last night, I fired a synthetic
molecule device into the parasite...

218
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:47,830
that transmits a specific pattern
of radio wave every three hours.

219
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:50,450
The transmitter will survive
for three days at most.

220
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:54,370
Its radio wave output strength is weak,
but the roadside cameras' surveillance antennae

221
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:58,370
that detect and control
illegal radio waves are able to receive it.

222
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:00,830
Wait a second, Tatsuya. Last night?

223
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:01,700
Where?

224
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,910
How did you find them?

225
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:08,240
This is the radio wave frequency and pattern.

226
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,490
You want us to use this
to find where the parasite is?

227
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:15,740
Why give this to us?

228
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:19,450
About the identity of the parasite
we're chasing...

229
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:23,990
it appears to be a magician
on the run from the USNA Army.

230
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:26,290
Also, there's more than one.

231
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:31,830
In fact, there are at least two deserters,
and there could be as many as ten or so.

232
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:34,580
Ten people deserted the Stars?

233
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:39,160
No, Erika, they aren't necessarily
part of the Stars.

234
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,160
Really?

235
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:45,410
The Stars are a unit
of exceptional magicians,

236
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:49,200
handpicked from the rest
of the USNA Army.

237
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:55,240
I thought military magicians
were strictly controlled in every country,

238
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,450
but has the USNA's military discipline loosened?

239
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:01,120
Actually, it's probably the opposite.

240
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,330
The opposite?

241
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:06,160
It would mean the parasites' influence
was stronger than military regulations.

242
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,790
Parasites change a human's nature, right?

243
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:14,080
If that change is mental
as well as physical...

244
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,870
it wouldn't be strange
for a host's sense of values to change.

245
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:20,910
That's true.

246
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:24,370
Then, why did the parasites desert?

247
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:28,330
We won't know until we catch
the parasites and question them.

248
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:31,290
So? What do you want us to do anyway?

249
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:34,620
I didn't intend to tell you what to do.

250
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:39,290
They hurt a friend of mine,
so I don't plan to leave them be.

251
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:44,870
At the same time, I'm not obsessed
with personally making them regret it.

252
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:49,740
If the Clans Council takes responsibility
for dealing with it, I won't complain.

253
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:54,700
Of course, I don't mind if the Chiba Family
hunts them on their own, either.

254
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,450
I apologize for having you
come all this way.

255
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:03,580
With things being as they are, I thought
giving these to you directly would be best.

256
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:07,330
No, it's fine. You've done well.

257
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:08,790
Excuse me.

258
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,580
Brother...

259
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:28,450
What's bothering you?

260
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:30,870
Nothing.

261
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:33,370
Is it about Lina?

262
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,370
You got me.

263
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:39,620
I can't hide anything from you, Miyuki.

264
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:44,700
I've known from the very beginning
that Lina has been plotting something.

265
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:50,830
But I didn't want to make any waves
in my own life, so I let her go.

266
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:53,660
And as a result, I was slow to react.

267
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,330
I mean, I get it.

268
00:20:55,330 --> 00:21:00,330
Even if I'd taken measures right away, there's
no guarantee I could've prevented the damage.

269
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:02,040
But...

270
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:06,160
when I'm confronted by the fact
that my friend got hurt,

271
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,950
I can't help thinking that
even if it's counterproductive.

272
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:15,580
Brother, you've become a kind person.

273
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:18,490
Miyuki? Where is this coming from?

274
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:22,740
Oh, I mean, you've always been kind.

275
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,830
It was just hard to see.

276
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:29,740
Sorry. Explain it to me
in a way I can understand.

277
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:35,620
You can't forgive the parasites
for harming your friend, Saijo.

278
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,950
And you also didn't want to get rough
with Lina because you're friends now

279
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:42,410
even if it's only been for a little while.

280
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:45,370
Brother...

281
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,620
That makes me happy.

282
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:53,410
The fact that you have compassion
for people other than me.

283
00:21:53,410 --> 00:22:01,120
Your emotions are far more human
than you think.

284
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,620
Oh, Brother...
You're hiding your embarrassment.

285
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:52,080
VISITOR ARC V
